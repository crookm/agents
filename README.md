# Build agent image definitions

This repo holds the definitions of the images I use for building. The agents produced by the scripts here can be used in any self-hosted CI platform like Azure Devops, GitHub, or Jenkins, but I primarily use it with TeamCity.

Much inspiration for the agent definitions was taken from the [GitHub Actions runners repo](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
